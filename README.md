# Attention
This truly isn't that difficult, however, I thought it'd be a great idea to make my own version of [@jscd_](https://twitter.com/jscd_)'s ["Boyfriend-Alert"](https://github.com/jscd/Boyfriend-Alert) project.

I'm using Heroku as a platform as a service (PaaS) to host the socket.io client (which is actually the web server) and I have the socket.io server running on my computer.

I added a few bonus features, such as the ability to see which programs are running. Also, this uses my Phillips hue lamp to flash rather than a raspberry pi & GPIO pins w/ LED. This, of course, gives us more opportunities for customization.

(I programmed this whole thing in about 45 minutes)
